From tone to textual analysis, RabbAI is an "in the know " Dvar Torah Generator and editor.

My approach to creating a genuine and personal tone was to keep the user involved throughout the entire processâ€”from setting preferences,
choosing between topics and routes, refining prompts, live editing, and restoring drafts, all the way to printing.
